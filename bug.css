The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior in the `box-shadow` property when used with certain values for the `inset` keyword and a large blur radius.  The shadow appears much larger than expected and extends beyond the confines of the containing element, creating a visual anomaly that is difficult to anticipate or debug. 

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 100px 50px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
```
